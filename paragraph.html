"In the moments following the successful test of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the lead scientist of the Manhattan Project, famously recalled a quote from the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Hindu scripture. He said, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.'

This profound statement captures the awe and responsibility that Oppenheimer felt upon witnessing the immense power of nuclear technology. It reflects the moral dilemma that scientists and society face when harnessing such tremendous forces of destruction. The Bhagavad Gita, with its rich philosophical teachings, provided Oppenheimer with the words to express the profound impact of this momentous event.

The quote is a translation of a verse from Chapter 11, Verse 32 of the Bhagavad Gita, where the deity Krishna reveals his divine form to the warrior Arjuna. It reads, 'Now I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds, the time to end has come.' Oppenheimer's choice to paraphrase this verse highlights the immense power unleashed by the atomic bomb, the devastating potential to end life as we know it.

Oppenheimer's reference to the Bhagavad Gita serves as a reminder of the ethical implications of scientific advancements and the need for responsible use of knowledge. It urges us to consider the consequences of our actions and to strive for a future where science and technology are guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of all life."
